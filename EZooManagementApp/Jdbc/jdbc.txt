		-JDBC is used to connect to the database
		-it is used to exchange data with database
		-JDBC is database independent meaning it can be used with various databases

	-We will follow folling steps 
		-Use basic classes of the api to get info from database

			-forName method of the CLASS class to load the driver
				Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
			-Use Connection Class to connect to the database
			-Method that return connection.
			public Connection getConnection()throws ClassNotFoundConnection,SQLException
				{
					Class.getName("org.postgresql.Driver")

					private String url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/eZoo";5432 is the port,eZoo is the name of the database in postgresql.
					private String username="postgres";//username for postgresSql 
					private String password="........";//password for postfresSql
					Connection conn= DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password);
					return conn;
				}
