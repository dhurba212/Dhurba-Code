DDL-Data Definition Language
	-Defines Database Structure or Scheme
		-Create-to create tables and other structures
			Create Table Customer(
				CustomerId Integer      Primary Key,
				fName      Varcahr(30)  Not null,
				lName      Varchar(30)  Not null,
				Age        Integer      Check(age>18)
			);
			Create Table Customer_phone(
				CustomerId  Integer   References Customer(CustomerId),
				Phone       Varchar   not null,
				Primary Key(CustomerId,Phone)
			);
		
		-Alter
			Alter Table Customer
				Add Birthday  Varchar not null;
							Or Can add multiple column at the same time
				Add (
				Birthday  Varchar  Not Null,
				Race      Varahcar Not Null,
				);

			Can Modify the data type of a column as well

			Alter Table Customer
				Modify CustomerId Varchar(30);
							Or Some SQL use
				Alter Column CustomerId  Varchar(30)

		-Drop
			Alter Table Customer
				Drop Column Birthday;
		-Rename Table
			Alter Table Customer
				Rename To MacysCustomer

		-Rename Column
			Alter Table Customer
				Rename Column CustomerId To Customer_ID;

					If that Column is referenced by a foreign key in another table, the foreign key should 
					automatically change name there as well, but if it doesn't you might have to do it on your own.
		-Change Constraint
			if a table has a constraint(I dont know if table does have a constraint, i thought only column can have constraint)?????
			Alter table Customer
				Drop Constraint Constraint_name(WHatever the constraint name is)
				Add Constraint Constraint_name constraint;

DML-Data Manupulative Language
	-to manage data within tables
	CRUD-
		Create(Insert)
			-Insert into Customer(CustomerId,FName,LName,Phone) Values
				(1,"Dhurba","Ghimire","123456789";
				 2,"      ","       ","          ";
				);
		Read(Select)
		Update
			
		Delete
			-Delete from Customer
				where customerId=1(it will delete a row with customerId =1)

TCL-Transaction Control Language-How DML statements are issued and executed
	-Set of SQL statement that are executed as a single expression
	meaning, all will be executed or none will be executed

Column-Each colum can hold single type of data
		-properties of data the data that a table stores.
		-for example-In a table of people,column represent People's properties like name, age 
			rows represent each person.
Rows-it is an entry.
	-representation of data in a table

Types of Data a column can hold, Remember each column can hold only one type of data
	-Varchar
	-Integer-32bits
	-Smallint-16bits(for smaller number)
	-Number(5,2)-for decimal number,(5,2) means total 5 and 2 decimal.i.e up to 3whole number , 2 decimal eg 100.45
	-Float-floating point number with no limit on digits
	-Date-date value
	-Timestamp-combination of date and time

	For each datatype u can have NULL value. Meaning empty
								NULL doesnt mean zero "0" or empty string "". it literally means nothing.


Table Constraints
	Rules that a are applied to the columns to restrict certain values within it.
		-Primary Key-a column whose value uniquely idetifies each row. It is unique in each row
			Composite Key-2 or more columns acting as primary key
		-Foreign Key-A column in one table that reference to the column in another table
				Primary and Forign Key forms the backbone or RDBMS.
		
		-Unique Key- should be unique in each row.Doesn't necessarily be Pimary key eg email address 
			no two person can have same email but a person might not have an email.
		-Not Null-Value Is Requited, cannot be left blank.
		-Check-a value in this column meets a specific condition
			eg certain age


Normalization-Have 6 or 7 normal form but if we can achieve 3 normal form thats good.
	Designing a database in such a way that
		-it doesn't have Composite Columns
		-Have no redundant data in a table
		-have relationship that makes sense
