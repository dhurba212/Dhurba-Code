-Different Database has different ways to create function
	besides the one that are already provided like SUM,COUNT,AVG,MIN,MAX.

-Although Different Database may differ but most of them follow following pattern

	CREATE FUNCTION function_name(Input1 type, Input2 type)
	RETURN return_type(eg integer or Varchar)
	BEGIN
		//Write logic

		RETURN value;
	END

-For Date and Time
	-PostgreSql: now(), PostgreSql also has Current_Timestamp so it can interpret code written for
		Oracle Database but the format of date and time might be different
	-Oracle:     Current_Timestamp
