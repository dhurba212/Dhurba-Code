		Protected
			-same package and subclasses from other package as well.
			                     |
							class B extends A

		Default
			-same package classes and subclasses

		Private
			-Only on the same class, NOT EVEN IN SUB CLASS OF THAT CLASS

iMPORTANT NOTES
	-if you want to expose the data in a class to outside manupulation best to make it private 
		and provide getter and setter methods.
			-Getter method returns the value of the variable stored in the object.
			-Setter method change the value of the variable stored in the object.

If you dont define a constructor, the class will have a default constructor.
We can have many constructor with different num of parameters or different arguments(Overloading);
					-Special method which is called during instantiation of class to create object and initialize the values of variables.
