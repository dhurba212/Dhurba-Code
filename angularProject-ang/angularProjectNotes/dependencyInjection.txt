DEPENDENCY INJECTION
  -instructing angular to inject dependency of the component into its constructor.
  -Dont forget to add the provider class of dependency into provider of app.module

When a Componennt is dependent on class Service,
  eg class CourseService
  {
    getCourses()
    {
      return ["Math","Science","English"];
    }
  }

  if we need to use this getCourse method in a COmponent then we can do as following

    class CourseComponent
    {
      courses;

      constructor()
      {
        let service = new CourseService()//creating object of CourseService to use its method getCourse().
                                          //Here CourseCOmponent is dependent on COurseService and if CourseService
                                          //add a parameter in future, it will create problem here, to avoid that we decouple that dependency by passing that into constructor
        this.courses=service.getCourse();
      }
    }


    A better way to do the same is:
      Here using the dependent Class(dependency)CourseService on Constructor,
        we are telling Angular to create an object of CourseService and pass it to CourseComponent
         doing so will decouple CourseComponent from future changes to CourseService.


    class CourseComponent
    {
      courses;

      constructor(service:CourseService)
      {
        this.courses=service.getCourses();
      }
    }
