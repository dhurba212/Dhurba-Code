We use service to get something from the server
  -its just a typescript written as courses.service.ts
  -we dont need to change this to a component, its simply a class

  //no component, service is plain typescript class
  export class CoursesService {

    getCourses()
    {
      return ["Math","science","english"];// just an example, in real world we get this list from database
    }
  }

  now we can use this method in other components to get the list of courses.
